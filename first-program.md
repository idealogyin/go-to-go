# First Program

## Classic Hello World Program in Go

Okay, so we are all set up with Go. Now let's create our hands dirty and create a trivial Hello World program. Let's create a file and it `hello.go`

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

That's it. We are done with our program and now save it in a file named `hello.go` Now Go provides us to compile and run the program in a single command. Fire up the terminal, head in a folder where we saved `hello.go` and run

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: For example code shown here refers to go environment in Ubuntu 18.04. Illustration may change a bit depending upon OS being used
{% endhint %}

```bash
go run hello.go
# => Hello World
```

This should output the &gt; Hello World string. Go also provides us a way to compile this program into executables by using `go build`

```bash
go build hello.go
# => This should create an executable in same directory
# => hello  hello.go
```

Is `hello` is an executable generated by `go build`. This can be run in terminal

```bash
./hello
# => Hello World
```
